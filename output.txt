If you follow any JavaScript publication or  newsletter you probably saw these disclaimers  
referencing Oracle's trademark ownership to  avoid legal complications. If you're like  
me you’ll probably ask yourself why  a company known for their databases,  
and not web development is involved in this.  Well, the explanation is kind of mind blowing.
In 1995, the web was still in its infancy, and  developers were experimenting with new ways to  
make websites more dynamic. Netscape, the company  behind the dominant web browser of the era,  
decided to create a scripting language  that could make websites interactive.
They called it Mocha at first, and then  LiveScript, but what’s more interesting,  
is that Brendan Eich was asked to  create this language in only 10 days,  
in an attempt from Netscape to gain an  edge over Microsoft in their browser wars.  
At the same time, Sun Microsystems was generating  buzz with their revolutionary programming  
language. Java's promise was ambitious.  Write once, run anywhere. Developers were  
intrigued by the idea of a language that  could seamlessly work across platforms.
So Netscape saw an opportunity to  capitalize on Java's popularity.  
They partnered with Sun Microsystems and  rebranded LiveScript as JavaScript, despite  
the two languages being entirely different. This naming decision wasn’t about technology.  
It was a marketing attempt to ride  the wave of Java’s growing fame.
Thanks to this publicity stunt, developers  started paying attention, even though,  
under the hood, JavaScript had little to do with  Java beyond some superficial syntax similarities.
Netscape's gamble worked, and JavaScript quickly  became a key part of the web’s evolution.
Fast forward to 2009, and Sun Microsystems,  the company that initially trademarked the name  
'JavaScript,' was acquired by Oracle. Oracle,  a company best known for its databases and  
enterprise software, inherited all of Sun's  assets, including the JavaScript trademark.
But despite their trademark ownership, Oracle  has no role in JavaScript's evolution or  
standardization. That responsibility belongs to  ECMA International, which oversees the ECMAScript  
standard. However, because the term JavaScript is  trademarked, many official documents, conferences,  
and publications use ECMAScript  instead to avoid legal issues.
As a consequence, Oracle's ownership  of the JavaScript trademark has  
raised eyebrows in the developer  community over the years. While  
it hasn’t directly impacted day-to-day  coding, it has created some confusion.
This situation has frustrated many  developers who feel the trademark serves  
no real purpose and adds unnecessary  complexity to JavaScript’s identity.
But things took a more serious turn  in 2024 when prominent figures in  
the JavaScript community decided enough was  enough. Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js,  
and Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript  itself, alongside other influential developers,  
published an open letter urging  Oracle to relinquish the trademark.
The first paragraph tells you  everything you need to know. 
“You have long ago abandoned the JavaScript  trademark, and it is causing widespread,  
unwarranted confusion and disruption.”
Then, in November 2024 Deno formally filed  a petition to cancel Oracle’s trademark.
If successful, conferences could reclaim titles  like “JavaScript Conference” instead of settling  
for “JSConf.” The language’s specification  could finally drop the cumbersome “ECMAScript”  
in favor of a straightforward“JavaScript  Specification”, and communities like “Rust  
for JavaScript Developers” would no longer  fear legal threats over their use of the term.
So here we are - we’ve moved from browser wars,  
to framework wars and now to trademark wars.  The web is, indeed, a fascinating place.
